# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Analysis
### Purpose
#### With dreams of opening a Surf and Shake shop that sells surfboards and ice cream to locals in Oahu, we proposed a detailed business plan to investors in hope that they would back our business and help us get started. Potential investors were worried about the weather in Oahu and how that could affect the overall success of the business, specifically -- if the shop had to close due to weather, resulting in a loss of profit and a potential risk of deficits. We decided to chose two months of the year that had substantial seasonal weather differences: June and December. By analyzing the weather during these two months, we will help provide clear insight into whether or not opening the Surf and Shake shop is an optimal business decision for investors. 

## Results
#### There are three key differences in the statistical weather description for June and December temperaturee:
1. Minimum Temperature
  * The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and in December the minimum temperature is 56 degrees. Overall, the difference in minimum temperature between the     two months is 8 degrees. Low temperature days in December will have a more significant negative impact on the sales of surfboards and ice cream because of the 
    colder weather.
2. 25% Quartile
  * In June, the lower quartile temperature is 73 degrees and in December the lower quartile temperature is 69 degrees. The difference in lower quartile
    temperatures between the two months is 4 degrees. With 25% of the values being less than 69 degrees during December, we can see that there are going to be some     days in December that are much colder than other days during December, which could result in less business for the shop on those days.
3. Count
  * Lastly, the month of June took into count many more temperatures than the month of December. This could be worrisome for investors because we are more concerned     about the weather during December because it is generally colder in the winter. Althouth the month of December still took into count 1,517 temperatures -- there     is still some missing data that could have a large impact on the results

## Summary
### The results of our analysis on the weather in Oahu in June and December show us that opening a Surf and Shake shop is an optimal business decisions for investors. Since the average temperature in Oahu during June and December ranges between 71 and 74 degrees, the weather generally permits a nice surf day and some ice cream. Investors can be confident in helping us get our business started since Hawaii has a tropical climate, resulting in warmer temperatures year round and an occasional colder day. Overall, a few colder days will not have a significant impact on the longevity and success of the Surf and Shake shop.
