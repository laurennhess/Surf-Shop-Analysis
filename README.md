# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Analysis
### Purpose
#### With dreams of opening a Surf and Shake shop that sells surfboards and ice cream to locals in Oahu, we proposed a detailed business plan to investors in hope that they would back our business and help us get started. Potential investors were worried about the weather in Oahu and how that could affect the overall success of the business, specifically -- if the shop had to close due to weather, resulting in a loss of profit and a potential risk of deficits. We decided to chose two months of the year that had substantial seasonal weather differences: June and December. By analyzing the weather during these two months, we will help provide clear insight into whether or not opening the Surf and Shake shop is an optimal business decision for investors. 

### Results
#### There are three key differences in the statistical weather description for June and December temperaturee:
1. Minimum Temperature
  * The minimum temperature is June is 64 degrees and in December the minimum temperature is 56 degrees. Overall, the difference in minimum temperature between the     two months is 8 degrees. Thus, low temperature days in December will have a more significant negative impact on the sales of surfboards and ice cream.
2. 25% Quartile
  * In June, the 25% quartile temperature is 73 degrees and in December the 25% quartile temperature is 69 degrees. The difference in 25% quartile temperatures         between the two months is 4 degrees. 
4. Count
